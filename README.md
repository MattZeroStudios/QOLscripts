# QOLscripts
A suite of scripts that get baked into a system to 
help manage a linux system for a non technical user.

example case:

Your mom gets a low end laptop and complains its too slow because, well windows ya know?
so you install your favorite linux distro and she has no idea how to maintain it.
This script comes into play by setting up cron jobs and having a gui menu to perform most of the common system upkeep
tasks. 

Tasks Automated:
- Malware Detection on the Home users
- Updating and upgrading ( done in a non intrusive manner by upgrading 10 packages and sleeping between upgrades)
- simple Android and IOS backups
- Optional backups
