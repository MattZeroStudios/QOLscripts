This script is to scan in the background home directories and quarantine files that are marked as "Malware" By ClamAV
If a file is marked by ClamAV it will display a pop up letting the user know a file was a hit for malware and has been
Quarantined. An amazing feature would be to pull ClamAV codes so you can manually quarantine or restore from it via
another popup window.
